# blackboard-lacapsule
An exercise to learn how to implement and set a database with MongoDB.
Then how to replace static data dynamically.

It is also an introduction to charts creation using the library Charts.js :
https://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.9.4/ 

In this case we have installed the 2.9.4 version (see https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js/2.9.4)

----
If you clone this repo, you can copy the collections saved in /DB-copy-collections-blackboard folder to provide fake data to start.

You will need to set NAME and PASS_W in a .env file with your own database information.
